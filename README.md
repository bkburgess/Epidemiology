# Epidemiology
This repository is a place for me to work on epidemiology simulations, primarily centered on using the SIRD model.

## SIRD
SIRD stands for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Dead. The idea is that the population of a a densely populated area will fall into one of these four categories at any given time, and we can use estimates and heuristics to model how the disease progresses over time.

### Further work
* Expand this to consider multiple cities simultaneously with travel between them
* Consider multiple diseases simultaneously
* Enable "researching" the disease to improve treatment to it
* Find an elegant way to plot the more sophisicated setup, preferably real time
